```
GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system ("html5lib"). This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.
```

To get rid of this warning, pass the additional argument 'features="html5lib"' to the BeautifulSoup constructor.
